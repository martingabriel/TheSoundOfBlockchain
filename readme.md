# The Sound Of Blockchain
The Sound Of Blockchain is app that allows you to listen blockchain sound (or "blockchain noise").

## How it works
- Download latest blockchain data (bitcoin blockchain data currently from [btc.com](https://btc.com/) API)
- Create sound file in wav format (with [header](http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/))
- Play sound data with AvAudioPlayer from latest blockchain data to previous blocks
- Have fun of that noise :)


This is personal project created in intention to learn Swift.
